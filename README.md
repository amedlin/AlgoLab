# ALGOLAB #

AlgoLab is a C++ multithreaded algorithm aggregation and sequencing framework that removes the messy 
and error-prone glue code that is often associated with developing compositional algorithmic systems.

With AlgoLab, you can quickly design and prototype composite algorithms consisting of flexible and
modular sub-algorithms, and have them up and running efficiently and concurrently in a short space
of time.

AlgoLab is designed around a declarative framework where algorithms are defined by the end user,
and dependencies between modules declared in an intuitive manner. Based on this declarative syntax
alone, modules are automatically sequenced and parallelised to be executed in an optimal manner.
No explicit thread invokation or synchronization is required on behalf of the end user.

We use C++11 as the minimum standard, ensuring you have all the benefits and performance gains of
modern C++.
